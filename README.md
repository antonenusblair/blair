This notebook explores the **Blair Non-Linear Quantum Calculus**, a proposed extension of standard quantum mechanics designed to address the quantum-to-classical transition and the measurement problem through state-dependent, emergent non-linearities. It provides a computational journey through the core concepts, mathematical framework, and key predictions of the Blair theory.

Reviewers are encouraged to **read the explanatory markdown cells** and **run the code cells** to interactively explore the framework's features and verify its behavior.

## Deriving Blair Parameters from First Principles

This section demonstrates how Blair parameters ($g^*, b^*$) and complexity tiers *emerge* directly from physical properties of the system and environment, moving away from fitting parameters.

Key concepts explored:
- System and Environment Properties (Hamiltonian, Density Matrix, Temperature, Decoherence Rate)
- Key Physical Measures (Energy Scale, Entanglement/Coherence, Coherence Time, System Timescale, Quantum-Classical Ratio)
- Complexity Tier determination based on the Quantum-Classical Ratio.
- Emergent parameters ($g^*, b^*$) derived from quantum resources and environmental interactions.

Run the code in the notebook to see how parameters and tiers adapt based on different physical conditions and to demonstrate the micro-meso-macro transition and convergence physics.

## Mathematical Proofs & QM Recovery

This section formally proves that in the limit of low complexity (the quantum regime), the Blair framework rigorously reduces to standard, linear Quantum Mechanics, preserving key features.

The notebook presents and demonstrates proofs for:
- **Emergent Linearity:** Showing the Blair equation becomes the Schrödinger equation when $g^*=0, b^*=0$.
- **Born Rule Recovery:** Demonstrating probability conservation.
- **No-Signaling Preservation:** Showing that local operations do not affect distant subsystems.
- **Numerical Stability:** Illustrating that numerical methods for the equation are stable in the quantum limit.
- **Complete Positivity:** Proving preservation of physical states.
- **Mathematical Well-Posedness:** Showing existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence of solutions.

## Novel Predictions

Explore the unique predictions the Blair framework makes in the mesoscopic and classical regimes where non-linearities are significant.

Predictions explored:
- **Scale-Dependent Coherence and Decoherence:** Coherence times depend on system complexity.
- **Non-Exponential Wavefunction "Collapse" Dynamics:** Faster-than-exponential convergence to pointer states.
- **Quantitative Quantum-Classical Boundary:** A physically-grounded transition based on system complexity.
- **Entanglement Suppression:** Nonlinear dynamics suppress entanglement growth.
- **Specific, Testable Experimental Signatures:** Concrete predictions for experiments.

Run the code to simulate these novel effects and see visualizations of the predicted behavior.

## Formal Axiomatic System

Delve into the formal mathematical structure of the Blair Non-Linear Quantum Calculus, including its axioms, definitions, and fundamental theorems.

Key elements:
- **Axioms:** Quantum State Manifold, Non-Linear Blair Derivative, Intrinsic Attractor Dynamics, Complexity-Adaptive Mathematics.
- **Definitions:** Blair Metric Tensor, Connection Coefficients, Covariant Derivative, Attractor Potential, Complexity Measure.
- **Theorems:** Emergent Linearity, Attractor Convergence, Complexity Monotonicity, Metric Compatibility.

The notebook provides demonstrations of computing mathematical quantities like the metric determinant and complexity measure for different states.

## Visualization of Geometry and Dynamics

Run simulations and generate plots to visualize the predicted Blair dynamics and the geometry of the state space.

Visualizations include:
- **Determinant of Blair Metric Tensor:** Showing the state-dependent curvature of the quantum manifold.
- **Time Evolution of Quantum Metrics:** Comparing Blair and Standard QM evolution of coherence, purity, and pointer state overlaps.
- **Bloch Sphere Trajectories:** Visualizing the path of a qubit state on the Bloch sphere under Blair and QM dynamics.
- **Attractor Potential on the Bloch Sphere:** Mapping the potential landscape that drives states towards pointer states.

## Resolution of Schrödinger's Cat Paradox

Explore how the Blair framework provides a physical resolution to the Schrödinger's Cat paradox by explaining the rapid, emergent classicality in macroscopic systems through state-dependent non-linear dynamics and intrinsic attractors. The high complexity of the cat system places it in the Macroscopic Regime (Tier 3), where large emergent parameters ($g^*, b^*$) cause rapid, non-unitary evolution away from superposition towards classical pointer states, resolving the paradox without ad hoc collapse postulates.
